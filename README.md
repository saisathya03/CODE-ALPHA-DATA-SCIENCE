üìà Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Using LSTM

This project focuses on analyzing stock market data and predicting future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.
The analysis is conducted on various technology stocks including Apple, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft.

üìù Project Overview
Time series data, particularly in the context of stock markets, is crucial for financial analysis. 
This notebook explores stock market data, performs risk analysis, and predicts future stock prices using LSTM.

Key Questions Addressed:
* What was the change in the price of the stock over time?
* What was the daily return of the stock on average?
* What was the moving average of the various stocks?
* What was the correlation between different stocks?
* How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
* How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior? (Predicting the closing price of Apple Inc. using LSTM)

üìä Data Source
The stock data is retrieved from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library. Yahoo Finance provides a rich dataset for financial market analysis.

üõ†Ô∏è Libraries and Tools Used
yfinance: For retrieving stock market data from Yahoo Finance
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For numerical computations
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the LSTM model
